### Legal (Copying, Patents, Trademarks, and Warranties)

IPDOS (tm), a.k.a. IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Distributed Operating System, is a fully proprietary software product with three unusual features.
First, all property and other rights in IPDOS (tm) are owned by "humanity yet unborn".
Second, there are no secrets; all of the source code is disclosed, so that anyone can browse, read, and study it.
Third, there is absolutely no grant of any license to use, copy, fork, build, publish, or otherwise disclose any of the content herein; *you may look, but you may not touch*.

Think of IPDOS (tm) as a totally "old school" proprietary commercial product owned by a company that *employs the entire human race*.
If you are human and breathing, you are given the privilege of reading the source code, just like a trusted employee of a software company.
But just like such an employee, your privilege of reading the source code is *NOT* accompanied by any authorization to disclose the source, to build it, or to use the resulting binaries.
