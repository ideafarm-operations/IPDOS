### Legal (Copying, Patents, Trademarks, and Warranties)

IPDOS (tm), a.k.a. IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Distributed Operating System, is a fully proprietary software product with three unusual features.
First, all property and other rights in IPDOS (tm) are owned by "humanity yet unborn".
Second, there are no secrets; all of the source code is disclosed, so that anyone can read it.
Third, there is **absolutely no grant of any license** to **use, copy, clone, fork, build, publish, or disclose** any of the content herein; *you may look, but you may not touch*.

Think of IPDOS (tm) as a totally "old school" proprietary commercial product owned by a company that *employs the entire human race*.
If you are human and breathing, you are given the privilege of reading the source code, just like a trusted employee in a software company.
But this privilege is *NOT* accompanied by any license to use or do anything else with it.
In particular, **you may not clone or fork this repository** (without written authorization).

The source code or other content disclosed herein might contain patentable ideas.
Any such ideas or other patentable intellectual property are hereby released into the public domain.

All of the content herein was developed by a single person.
Any patentable ideas contained herein were discovered independently and without the benefit of any review of published patents.
Patent rights are great for kitchen gizmos, but the idea sucks totally when applied to software.
*Message to patent trolls:  Eat Shit and Die.*

IdeaFarm (tm) and SOIL (tm) are trademarks of Wo Of Ideafarm who, as Governing Proprietor of IdeaFarm (tm) City, holds them in trust for "humanity yet unborn".

Since all rights to use the content herein is reserved (**no** license to use is granted), the following statement is superfluous.
**No warranty of any kind is made or implied.**  You may only read the content herein.  You may not use it.  If you do so, you do so at your own risk.

If any part of this declaration that all rights to copy are reserved is held to be unenforceable in any court of law, the terms of this declaration shall be severable.
